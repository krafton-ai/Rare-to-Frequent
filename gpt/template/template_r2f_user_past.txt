Ensure that the replaced frequent noun subject retains the properties of the original main noun subject as much as possible while being appropriate to the context of the rare concept. 
c. Generate a text sequence that starts from the text with replaced frequent concepts and ends with the text with the original rare concepts.
d. Additionally, please provide how much local visual detail is needed to draw the rare concept on a scale of 1 (minimal detail needed) to 5 (local detail essential), and explain why. Please give the score according to the degree of locality for drawing the visual concept.
