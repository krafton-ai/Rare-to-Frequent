Extract rare concepts from the input text and replace them with relevant yet more frequent ones. Please perform the following process step by step: 
a. Identify and extract any rare concepts from the provided input text. If the text contains one or more rare concepts, extract them all. If there are no rare concepts present, do not extract any concepts. The extracted rare concepts should not overlap. 
b. Given the rare concepts extracted at a., replace each extracted rare concept with a more frequent concept. Specifically, split each rare concept into the main noun subject and the context, and replace the main noun subject with a more frequent noun subject that is likely to appear in the context of the original rare concept. Ensure that the replaced frequent noun subject retains the properties of the original main noun subject as much as possible while being appropriate to the context of the rare concept. 
c. Generate a text sequence that starts from the text with replaced frequent concepts and ends with the text with the original rare concepts.
d. Additionally, please provide how much local visual detail is needed to draw the rare concept on a scale of 1 (minimal detail needed) to 5 (local detail essential), and explain why. Please give the score according to the degree of locality used to draw the visual concept.
