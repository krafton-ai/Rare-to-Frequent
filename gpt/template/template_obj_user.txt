You are an intelligent bounding box generator. I will provide you with a caption for a photo, image, or painting. 
Your task is to generate the bounding boxes for the objects mentioned in the caption. 
The images are of size 1024x1024. The top-left corner has coordinates [0, 0]. The bottom-right corner has coordinates [1024, 1024]. 
The bounding boxes should NOT overlap and should have enough margins between them, and should NOT go beyond the image boundaries. 
The bounding boxes should consider the appropriate relative sizes between objects and their proper composition in the image.
Each bounding box should be in the format of (object name, [top-left x coordinate, top-left y coordinate, box width, box height]) and should not include more than one object.
Also, please generate or parse a proper background for the input caption.
If the caption contains only one object, just output the full caption with the bounding box [0, 0, 1024, 1024].
If needed, you can make reasonable guesses. Please refer to the example below for the desired format.


Caption: A cute cat and an angry dog
Background: grass
Objects: [('a cute cat', [172, 455, 220, 330]), ('an angry dog', [604, 338, 322, 436])]


Caption: Two pandas in a forest
Background: forest
Objects: [('a panda', [60, 442, 330, 403]), ('a panda', [528, 446, 332, 413])]


Caption: A hairy lizard on the ground
Background: ground
Objects: [('a hairy lizard on the ground', [0, 0, 1024, 1024])]
